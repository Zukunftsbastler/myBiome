Completed: 
    Phase 1 (headless core), 
    Phase 2 (visualization),
    Phase 3 (UI & interaction)


Logical next phases:

  Phase 4: Campaign & Progression

  - Quest/Objective system — threshold triggers, stability checks, discovery events
  - Skill tree with 3 paths: Biology (seed selection, genetic editor), Engineering (terraforming tools), Science (sensor unlocks, prediction)

  Phase 5: Fauna & Behavior

  - Utility AI for animals, tropism vectors for roots/swarms
  - Sensor system (gradient, signature, internal inputs)
  - New entity types beyond plants

Later phases include:

  - Phase 6: Procedural audio (Web Audio API synthesis)
  - Phase 7: Advanced ecosystem mechanics (decomposition networks, tipping points)
  - Phase 8: Tutorial & onboarding state machine
  - Phase 9: God mode / automation / drones
  - Phase 10: Scenario presets (Mars terraforming, post-fire recovery)
